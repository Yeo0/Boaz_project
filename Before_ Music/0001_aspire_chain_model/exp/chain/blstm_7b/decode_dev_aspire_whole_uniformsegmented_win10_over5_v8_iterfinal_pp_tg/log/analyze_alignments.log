The optional-silence phone sil occupies 43.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 73.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 27.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.3 hours of data, or 1.9 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 9.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,13.0,52)
