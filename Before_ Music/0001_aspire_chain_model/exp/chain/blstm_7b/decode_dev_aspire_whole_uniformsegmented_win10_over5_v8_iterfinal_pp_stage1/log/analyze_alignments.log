The optional-silence phone sil occupies 46.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 72.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 29.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.3 hours of data, or 1.8 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 9.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,14.1,58)
